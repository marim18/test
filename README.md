This is the readme file for the group project of exam unit 4 and Esports practise 4 fitness game project.
The partipcating students are Jon Georg Magnussen, Maria Møll,Daryna Myronenko and Joakim Spansgaard Gratland
The project has been through several stages. the earliest stage was based on a different flowchart which can be found on the other branch. 
https://github.com/marim18/FitnessGame/tree/master
it has two branches neither which we kept going with for the end result.
 But the effort put into this part is worth documenting. 

The flowchart for this project can be found in the repository on github.  
We struggled for several days to get the buttons to work before simon came and helped us realize it was a hardware issue, 
hence the spontanious ty simon commit message if you should be curious. 

The code itself is inspired by simon says and is a combo trainer for games. It is used to train reaction and hand eye coordination. 
The current version is runnable all the way to victory but may occationally refuse to start up. If you try again usually it works out.. 

Previously we attempted to split the displaying of the randomsequence from the generation of the randomsequence.
 I will push this version to my branch on the old repository so you can see but it was not running.
 We also tried moving everything out of main but it caused null pointer errors and alot of pain so it was moved back because of time constraint. 
If we had more time we would improve the code so that it follows conventions better and was less functions inside function. 
However it is now working as intended and has been tested. The test data we have each made programs to get.

But make no mistake! THIS IS THE PROJECT WE DELIVER:
https://github.com/marim18/test
Not the other one!
Pls be leanient if any of our teamamtes delivered the wrong file because of my naming habits.
